      HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in
      1991. Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is widely recognized as
      the inventor of the World Wide Web. He developed HTML as a way to share
      and structure documents on the web, laying the foundation for modern web
      development. While the initial version was HTML 1.0, the first
      standardized version, HTML 2.0, was published in 1995.
